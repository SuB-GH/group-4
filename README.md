# Group-4 Project: Staring at the Stars!

## Purpose
For this project, our group wanted to create a website that would allow stargazers and amateur astronomers the opportunity to glimpse the International Space Station. A user simply has to enter a city into the search bar and upon enter, several time intervals in which to view the satellite will be produced. We also included local hourly weather so that gazers will be able to predict when viewing conditions will be optimal. As an added touch of fun and space-y class, we have also included Nasa's Astronomy Picture of the Day.
